# Assignment 8: Scheduling
## Objective
The goal of this week's assignment is to deal with scheduling of interactive and real time systems.

## Required Tasks
Answer the following questions

1. **Round-Robin Scheduler --- Discussion**
Round-robin schedulers normally maintain a list of all runnable processes, with each process occurring exactly once in the list. What would happen if a process occurred twice in the list?

1. **Multiple Queues**
A process on a system with Multiple Queues Scheduling needs 30 quanta to complete. How many times must it be swapped in, including the very first time (before it has run at all)?

2. **Shortest Process Next**
A scheduler working with the {\em Shortest Process Next} Strategy has two processes in ready state and has to schedule one of these:

| Process Name | 1st run | 2nd run | 3rd run | 4th run |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
A | 50 msec | 150 msec | 300 msec | 85 msec |
B | 300 msec | 150 msec | 85 msec | 50 msec

Which process will be taken by the scheduler and why?

3. **CPU-bound and I/O-bound Processes**
	- Explain in a few words the terms CPU-bound and I/O-bound processes.
	- Why is it important for the scheduler to distinguish between CPU-bound and I/O-bound processes?

4. **Real Time Schedulable**
A soft real-time system has four periodic events with periods of 50, 100, 200, and 250 msec each. Suppose that the four events require 35, 20, 10 and $x$ msec of CPUtime, respectively. What is the largest value of $x$ for which the system is schedulable?
